This is replication of the work provided in link [SketchANet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07873).

In summary, this is a multi-scale multi-channel deep convolutional neural network framework that, for the first time, yields sketch recognition performance surpassing that of humans.

The CNN architecture is given in below:
