This is a replication of the work provided in the link [SketchANet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07873).

In summary, it is a multi-scale, multi-channel deep convolutional neural network framework that, for the first time, yields sketch recognition performance surpassing that of humans.

The CNN architecture details:
